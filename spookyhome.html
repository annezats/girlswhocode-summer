What you may not know will surprise you. And we are here to tell you exactly what you do not know. And that happens to be all this super sick information! About greek mythology!!!
<p>Here I am just putting some words on the page so that you stop reading. there is nothing interesting past this point. Have fun and move on to the other things you can click on this site theres lots of cool info about dragons and sphinxes and sirens if you can read latin:). okay cool they're gone now we can talk about our scheme for WORLD DOMINATION. I quite like the whole hypnosis and brainwashing thing but brute force might also work. The current political climate is ridiculous don't you think? uhhhhhhh ok have fun bye
